# Easy Blockchain

This project is a simple demo of how blockchain technology works.

## Purpose

The only purpose was my curiosity about what is happening under the hood of Bitcoin. I was interested in what exactly is a generic block, a prize, an effort of the network as well as how one mined block affects the another, making it safe for frauds.

## Used technologies

- Visual Studio 2019
- Visual C++
- .Net Framework (probably, not sure ðŸ˜…)

## How to start

Use Visual Studio, it should tell what is needed to run this project ðŸš€.
